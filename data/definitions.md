# ASKING REFLECTIVE QUESTIONS
This is a powerful skill for learning that anyone can use to promote reflection in others. Used in teams, it not only fosters reflective inquiry, but may also help build trust and encourage diversity of thought.

There are many tools available to help us develop our reflective questioning capability. The 4A's reflective questioning framework is one example.
