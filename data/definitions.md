# PAIRING
Pairing essentially involves working in partnership with someone, in real-time, towards the same goal. It is typically practiced by developers when writing code, but you can pair on non-coding activities too.

Pairing offers many benefits, not least in supporting person-to-person knowledge transfer and diversity of thinking. For a more complete description of paired programming and its benefits, refer to RESOURCE. It may also be advisable to consider challenges associated with pairing and to be mindful about when it is applied (RESOURCE).

# ASKING REFLECTIVE QUESTIONS
This is a powerful skill for learning that anyone can use to promote reflection in others. Used in teams, it not only fosters reflective inquiry, but may also help build trust and encourage diversity of thought.

There are many tools available to help us develop our reflective questioning capability. The 4A's reflective questioning framework is one example.

# WALK AND TALKS
A walk and talk is simply a conversation away from the desk. You might combine it with another activity, such as walking the dog or visiting an art gallery. The change of environment and physical movement can stimulate fresh thinking and help to avoid other distractions and relational barriers associated with being in an office environment. Bear in mind this format may not be suitable for every topic of conversation, and that the activity and location should feel comfortable and accessible to all participants.

# PROCESSING PAUSES
A processing pause means taking time to think and/or 'be' after an emotional or cognitively intensive experience. For example, processing pauses can be worked in and around meetings, workshops and other situations at work when you're having to react or problem-solve in the moment.

During a processing pause you might want to write things down, reflect on a recent experience, or simply check in with yourself and how you are feeling in the moment.
