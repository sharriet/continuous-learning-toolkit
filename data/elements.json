It is typically practiced by developers when writing code, but you can pair on non-coding activities too. Pairing offers many benefits, not least in supporting person-to-person knowledge transfer and diversity of thinking. You should also consider the challenges associated with pairing and be mindful about when and how it is applied.",

Look for ways to normalise asking for help in your team(s), and ensure that the help people receive is actually helpful. For example, you might consider creating dedicated help channels where people can easily connect around a question or problem; you might work to foster a 'culture of help' in your organisation or team, which will most likely neccessitate a 'whole person' approach, as opposed to focusing soley on work matters; you might also give people a base level of teaching and mentoring skills to make them better helpers. Perhaps most importantly, foster a culture of collaboration and 'Teaming', whereby people will instinctively call on each other to solve a problem.",
